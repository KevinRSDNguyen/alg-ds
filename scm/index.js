// --- Directions
// Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be
// evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers in the range
// between these parameters.
// For example, if given 1 and 3, find the smallest common multiple of both 1
// and 3 that is also evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3. The answer
// here would be 6.
// --- Examples:
//  smallestCommons([1, 5]) OR smallestCommons([5, 1]) should return 60.
